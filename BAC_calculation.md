## Widmark's Basic Formula

Let
A = liquid ounces of alcohol
W = weight of person in pounds
r = alcohol distribution ratio, 0.73 for men, 0.66 for women
H = period in hours since alcohol was consumed

%BAC =  ((A * 5.14) / (W * r)) – (0.015 * H)

###An example

A man weighing 160 pounds consumes 1 shot (1.5 oz) of 80 proof alcohol. What is his BAC 15 minutes later?

A = 0.6
W = 160
r = 0.73
H = .25 (15 mins)

(A * 5.14/W * r) – .015 * H
((0.6 * 5.14) / (160 * 0.73)) - (0.015 * 0.25) = 0.022 BAC%
