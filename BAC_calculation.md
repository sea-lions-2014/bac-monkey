## Widmark's Basic Formula

Let    
A = liquid ounces of alcohol  
W = weight of person in pounds  
r = alcohol distribution ratio, 0.73 for men, 0.66 for women  
H = period in hours since alcohol was consumed  

%BAC =  ((A * 5.14) / (W * r)) – (0.015 * H)

###An example

A man weighing 160 pounds consumes 1 shot (1.5 oz) of 80 proof alcohol. What is his BAC 15 minutes later?

A = 0.6 
W = 160 
r = 0.73  
H = .25 (15 mins) 

(A * 5.14/W * r) – .015 * H
((0.6 * 5.14) / (160 * 0.73)) - (0.015 * 0.25) = 0.022 BAC%
