class SubstanceCalc
    #-----THESE SHOULD BE ASSIGNED IN SUBCLASS #initialize-----

    #---@elimination_rate---
    # Rate at which a substance is eliminated from the body per hour.
    # Should be a percentage (e.g. 0.12 for 12%).

    #---@precision---
    # Number of decimal points to preserve in the mg calculations.
    # Substances that are measured in smaller doses should use higher
    # precision.


    #------------------------------------------------

    # Given the amount of substance consumed over a period of time, mg_series
    # returns a data-point series of mg concentrations at 15 minute intervals
    # as a nested array. The argument hash has the following:
    # {
    #   starting_mg: optional, defaults to 0
    #   milligrams: mgs of the substance,
    #   hours: time spent continually consuming the substance, in intervals of 0.25
    #   interval_count: optional, defaults to 49 (12 hours of data-points)
    # }
